## Description

A repository to host microfluidic chip design schematics and fabrication procedures.
The designs are heavily based on published ones from the [Laboratory of Biological Network Characterization](http://lbnc.epfl.ch/index.html) (LBNC) in EPFL. The LBNC designs can be found [here](http://lbnc.epfl.ch/microfluidic_designs.html). In this repository you will currently find `.dxf` AutoCAD files containing our modified design of the PDMS chip (located in `src/` folder), as well as various figures and `.drawio` files used in [AcubeSAT](https://acubesat.spacedot.gr/)'s [CDR](https://gitlab.com/acubesat/documentation/cdr-public/). You can find a prototype [flow layer](https://benchling.com/protocols/S5hXaszw/flow-layer-pdms-fabrication) and [control layer](https://benchling.com/protocols/ABdPP2IQ/control-layer-pdms-fabrication
) fabrication protocol over at Benchling.
