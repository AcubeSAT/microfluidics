# Microfluidics

A repository to host microfluidic chip design schematics and fabrication procedures.

The designs are heavily based on published ones from the [Laboratory of Biological Network Characterization](http://lbnc.epfl.ch/index.html) (LBNC) in EPFL.

## Resources

* Protocols and workflows for the wet lab/microfluidic experiments can be found [here](https://benchling.com/organizations/acubesat/).
* The [Wiki page](https://gitlab.com/acubesat/su/microfluidics/-/wikis/Design) contains documentation regarding the step-by-step design process.
* The published/initial microfluidic designs were acquired from/can be found [here](http://lbnc.epfl.ch/microfluidic_designs.html).
