## Description

A repository to host microfluidic chip design schematics and fabrication procedures.
The designs are heavily based on published ones from the [Laboratory of Biological Network Characterization](http://lbnc.epfl.ch/index.html) (LBNC) in EPFL. The LBNC designs can be found [here](http://lbnc.epfl.ch/microfluidic_designs.html). In this repository you will currently find `.dxf` AutoCAD files containing our modified design of the PDMS chip, as well as various figures and `.drawio` files used in [AcubeSAT](https://acubesat.spacedot.gr/)'s [CDR](https://gitlab.com/acubesat/documentation/cdr-public/)
